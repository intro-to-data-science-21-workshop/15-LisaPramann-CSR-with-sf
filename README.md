# Coordinate Reference Systems with sf 


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) Berlin in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course Introduction to Data Science taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Workshop contents

This workshop-session you new insights into working with Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) in R. These systems are central when working with data related to the surface of the earth and other geographic elements. Besides this, sf builds also the foundations of creating nice maps based on geographic data points.

You can access our exercise file [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop/15-LisaPramann-CSR-with-sf/a564a915c14c049c448f8f93c5aa230506466050/02_workshop_exercise/crs_sf_workshop_exercises.html). 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this workshop are to 
1) introduce you to CRS foundations and its application in R, 
2) 2) try out simple data operations and visualizations with sf, and 
3) 3) provide you with some practice material as well as some further resources.
