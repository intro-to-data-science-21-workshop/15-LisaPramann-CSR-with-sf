Hello everyone `r emo::ji("wave")`, 

we hope you have enjoyed our small presentation, refreshed your knowledge about Coordinate Reference Systems and got some insights on how geographic data they works in R and what potential data operations can be done with it.

Ready to play around with sf and do some simple operations and create a nice map in the end (hopefully) `r emo::ji("heart_eyes")`?  


*** 

In this little exercise we would like you to 


* **get a better feeling for CRS and the `sf`- package**  
* **understand how to access and read CRS data in R**
* **do simple data operations** 
* **learn how to create cool and interactive maps based on geographic data**

### Exercise (1) 
**In your own words, why do we need a ‚ÄúCoordinate Reference System‚Äù (CRS)?** 
```{r}
#
#
```
# Setup

The first step is to download the concerning packages and import the libraries for using `sf` and the *spatial data*.

```{r}
# install.packages("sf", "spData", "spDataLarge")

# The Essentials
library(sf)   # classes and functions for vector data
library(tidyverse)     # for tidy data and ggplot2

# Datasets
library(rgdal) # dataset of city centers (points)
library(spData) # load explanatory geographic data
library(spDataLarge) # load larger geographic data 

#(Intermediary Mapping)
library(tmap) # to create nice and interactive maps
library(jsonlite) # Convert R objects to/from JSON
```
Be careful: There might be a little bug in installing `sf` and `spData`. If you‚Äôre running Mac or Linux, installing `sf` may not work directly. Please have a look [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) to download the relevant packages. Then use the `library()` command to load them.

# Exploring CRS in R

For these exercises we will work with the same dataset from the video. Our new object, `new_vector`, will be a polygon representing a world map. (For more info: ?spData::world).

First import the data and make it a readable to `sf`:
```{r}
vector_filepath <- system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package = "spData")
new_vector <- read_sf(vector_filepath)
```
We've also loaded in a dataset of city centers from the `rgdal` package as the object `cities`.
```{r, include=FALSE}
cities_world <- system.file("vectors/cities.shp", package = "rgdal")
cities <- st_crs(3138)
```

*** 
## Retrieve the CRS from objects `new_vector` and `cities`{.tabset} 

### Exercise (2)
** Using `st_crs` what can you tell about the data? Ex. the Datums and the retrieved Coordinate Reference System**
```{r}
#
#
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#They are different! new_vector is from WGS 84 and cities is from EPSG:3138. wGS 84 is the most common to use and stands for World Geodetic System 1984. 
```

### new_vector
```{r}
st_crs(new_vector)
```
### cities
```{r}
st_crs(cities)

```

$~$

***
## Use `st_set_crs` to Add or Change CRS

```{r}
CRS_vector <- st_set_crs(world, "EPSG:4326")

```

To look up different Datums you can use a website for [Coordinate Systems Worldwide](https://epsg.io/)

### Exercise (3)
**How can we change the Datum for `cities`?** 
```{r}
#
#
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#Check if your object already has a Datum. 
#Decide on the up the Datum code (use epsg.io to look up options)
#Use st_set_crs()

```

# Geographic Data Operations

## Geometric measurements

In the short presentation we have shown you the following examples of how to conduct two types of geometric measurements with the `sf`-package 

*Example 1 from presentation:*
```{r}
Belgium <- world %>% 
  filter(name_long == "Belgium")
st_area(Belgium) 

units::set_units(st_area(Belgium), km^2)
```

We can also do this calculation for a US-state:
```{r}
Florida <- us_states %>% 
  filter(NAME == "Florida")
st_area(Florida) 
```

### Exercise (4)
**`st_area()` is giving us the output in m^2. The output is however really difficult to read, and the US does operate with *miles*. How can we get an output in squared miles?** 
```{r}
#
#
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
units::set_units(st_area(Florida), mi^2)
```

***
*Example 2 from presentation:*

Measuring the distance from a cycle hire point at the *Palace Gate* in London to the center of *Redbridge*.
```{r, warning = FALSE}
cycle_station_palace <- cycle_hire %>% 
  filter(name == "Palace Gate")
redbridge <- lnd %>% 
  filter(NAME == "Redbridge")
redbridge_centroid <- st_centroid(redbridge)
st_distance(cycle_station_palace, redbridge_centroid)
```

### Exercise (5)
**Have a look at the Code. What are the three steps one has to make, to measure distance between two geometric data points? Can we change the units of the output here, too? How?**
```{r}
#
#
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#1.Filter the Data Points from their data set
#2.Define the the center, concrete geometric data point if one should 
#  be an area (by using st_centroid() for example )
#3.Use st_distance() to measure the distance, default output is in meters.
#Unfortunately we cannot use the units package to set the units here, but we can do it manually /1000 for example to get km 
```

* Tip: other interesting functions to explore geometric relations and distances with are `st_within()`,`st_is_within_distance()` or `st_touches()`. If you would like to find out what they do have a look [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_binary_pred.html).

## Creating maps wit CRS data `r emo::ji("world_map")` {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

In the presentation we have shown how to use `sf` in combination with `ggplot` or the `sf` and  `plot()` function to create simple maps. 

### Example with ggplot()

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# load state capitals of the US
state_capitals <- fromJSON(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/us-state-capitals.json"
  )
# turn it into an sf object
state_capitals_sf <- st_as_sf(state_capitals, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)
# remove alaska and hawaii
state_capitals_sf <- state_capitals_sf[
  !state_capitals_sf$state %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii"),
  ]


ggplot() +
geom_sf(data = us_states) + 
coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326)) +
  geom_sf(color = "#AD33FF", alpha = 0.1, size = 6, data = state_capitals_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = "#AD33FF", alpha = 0.1, size = 5, data = state_capitals_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = "#AD33FF", alpha = 0.2, size = 4, data = state_capitals_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = "#AD33FF", alpha = 0.2, size = 3, data = state_capitals_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = "#AD33FF", alpha = 0.4, size = 2, data = state_capitals_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = "#AD33FF", alpha = 1, size = 1, data = state_capitals_sf) +
  labs(title="US States and their Captials", 
       caption = "Excluding Alaska and Hawaii")
```
Example from the presentation using `ggplot()` in combination with `geom_sf()` from the `sf` package on data CRS data from the US retrieved from the `spData` package.

### Example with plot()

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
us_income <- left_join( 
  us_states, us_states_df, 
  by = c("NAME" = "state"))

plot(us_income["median_income_15"], 
     main = "Median income per State in 2015")
```

Example from the presentation using `plot()` on data CRS data from the US and attributed data on the median income per state, both retrieved from the `spData` package.

## Public Policy implications 
### Exercise (6)
**During this workshop we've covered what CRS data is, the functions of the sf package, and how it can be used. Now brainstorm some applications; What are scenarios (how or when) where you can apply these tools in the future?** 
```{r}
#
#
```


***

## Take-home exercise: Introducing tmap()
### Exercise (7)
**In the presentation we mentioned the `tmap` package which offers a bit more comprehensive tools, for example interactive mapping. Please do a quick research. Which function from the `tmap`-package can we use to set an interactive view of a map?**
```{r}
#
#
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#Answer: Each map can be plotted as a static image or viewed interactively using "plot" and #"view" modes, respectively. The mode can be set with the function tmap_mode

data("World") #The object World is a spatial object of class sf from sf 
tmap_mode("view") # this is the important function to build interactive maps
tm_shape(World) +
    tm_polygons("well_being")

```
